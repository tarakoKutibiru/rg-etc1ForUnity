# rg-etc1 for Unity

# Overview

This is [rg-etc1](https://code.google.com/archive/p/rg-etc1/) wrapped for Unity.

This package was created to compress Texture2d loaded at runtime.

There are similar assets in the Unity Asset Store, but they did not work well in my environment, and I was curious about how to create native plug-ins, so I created this for learning purposes.

[Realtime Texture Compression for Android(ETC1)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/realtime-texture-compression-for-android-etc1-7724?locale=ja-JP)

If you are using Unity v2021 or higher, you may want to try [Texture2d.Compress](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture2D.Compress.html).
